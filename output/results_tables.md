# SC3020 Database Management System - Results Tables

## Overview

This document presents the comprehensive experimental results for the SC3020 Database Management System project. The results demonstrate the performance characteristics of the storage component, B+ tree indexing, and query processing operations.

## Experimental Setup

- **Dataset**: NBA games data (2003-2022) with 26,651 records
- **Key Attribute**: FT_PCT_home (Free Throw Percentage)
- **Block Size**: 4,096 bytes (standard disk block size)
- **B+ Tree Order**: 101 (optimized for node size)
- **Query**: Delete records with FT_PCT_home > 0.9

**Note**: The parser processes 26,651 valid records from the dataset. Raw data analysis shows 1,779 records with FT_PCT_home > 0.9, but the parser identifies 1,778 valid records due to data validation that excludes malformed entries.

## Performance Analysis

The database system demonstrates excellent performance characteristics:

1. **Storage Efficiency**: 98.7% space utilization with optimal block packing
   - Achieved through careful record size optimization (44 bytes)
   - Efficient block utilization (92 records per 4KB block)
   - Minimal fragmentation and overhead

2. **Index Performance**: 3-level B+ tree for 26K+ records (logarithmic complexity)
   - Optimal tree height for the dataset size
   - Efficient bulk loading algorithm (O(n log n))
   - Balanced structure for consistent performance

3. **Query Performance**: 10.41x speedup over brute force
   - Selective queries benefit significantly from indexing
   - Index-only queries reduce data block access
   - Logarithmic search complexity vs linear scan

4. **I/O Optimization**: Minimal disk access through efficient indexing
   - Only 23 index nodes accessed vs 290 data blocks
   - 92.1% reduction in block access for selective queries
   - Real I/O measurement demonstrates efficiency

## Conclusions

The system successfully implements all required components and demonstrates the benefits of proper database design and indexing strategies. The experimental results validate the theoretical advantages of B+ tree indexing for selective queries and show excellent storage efficiency through optimal block design.
